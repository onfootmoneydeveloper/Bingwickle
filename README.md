# Bingwickle v.1one
 Ticket reference tracker

 Bingwickle is a text-based ticket reference tracker designed to make daily ticket work more rewarding. Instead of starting fresh each day with a new notepad, Bingwickle lets you seamlessly continue tracking your ticket count across days, months, and even years. It keeps a running total of completed tickets, turning your everyday workflow into a fun and motivating experience.

 **NOTE** some functions and layout settings are only visable in Win10. But these will be fixed after release so they work in Win11.
